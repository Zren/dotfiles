# Missing Palette Commands

I really like the _Command Palette_ feature of Sublime Text 2.
The only problem I have with it is that some useful commands
have been omitted and are only available through the main menu.

This package provides a `.sublime-commands` file that contains
the missing commands. You can install it using [Package Control].
